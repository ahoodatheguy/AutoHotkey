# My AutoHotkey Scripts

These are a collection of scripts I use to speed up my workflow.

## A note on Keyboards

My setup uses two keyboards. To do this, I use a software called [AutoHotInterception](https://github.com/evilC/AutoHotInterception), you need to set it up and replace any instances of my keyboard ID (`0x040B, 0x2000`) with your own.
